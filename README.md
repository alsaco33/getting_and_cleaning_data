# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
As the instructions indicate, this piece of code does the following:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
As long as the datasets from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip are downloaded in the repository, running run_analysis.R will create the tidy.txt result file.
